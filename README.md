# Welcome to my suite of TTRPG applications

## Context

- I like TTRPG.
- I like coding.
- I want to learn Rust.
- I want to try frontend/GUI work.

Note: I am using a mix of Co-pilot and Google Gemini for this project to experiment how well they work to teach me to code in Rust. Once I complete a couple of applications using their assistance, I will try to complete a few applications on my own.

## What is in this suite?

### A D&D Initiative Tracker

I thought this was a nice project to start learning Rust. The logic is simple. The UI is doable.

## Future Plans

- Thinking of creating a landing page or a side panel where all the different tools can be accessed. Right now there is only one tool.
- Whole character sheets? At least for simpler for games like Honey Heist, Blades in the Dark, etc.

## Recording my thoughts

For this project, I am recording my thoughts on the use of Gemini and Co-Pilot [here](Thoughts.md).
