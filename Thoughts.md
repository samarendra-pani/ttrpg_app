# Thoughts on the use of Co-Pilot and Google Gemini

## Initial Implementation of D&D Initiative Tracker and Landing Page

- This is my first time using Gemini for intense programming.
- It definitely made the process much much faster.
- Have I learnt all that has been coded in this repository? No. But it has given me a good idea of the concepts in Rust and in general made me quite comfortable.
- The biggest thing is probably the sense of achievement in creating something that works albeit the "creation" is not soley from me but with assistance.
- I started learning Rust using its main documentation initially but soon got bored.
- I always like to learn using dummy projects. Now creating results in these projects can be quite frustrating especially if it is something that is being done outside of official work.
- Gemini does make the process much easier due to feedback.
